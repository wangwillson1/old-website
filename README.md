# My Personal Website [WIP]
This is all the code behind my personal website. 

## Languages and Frameworks
This website was constructed with HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap 4 framework. In the future, I hope to use ReactJS to improve the website.

## Features to include:
- Adding animations on load (ex. elements fading in from sides)
- Fixing dropdown in navbar to be animated

## Current Bugs
- Anchors currently do not link to the correct position (slight offset due to navbar)
- Little blue marks beside the social media icons when hovering over
